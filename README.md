# Control Guide for the Solar System Simulation

---

## 🌌 **Navigation and Camera Controls**
- **`C`**: Center the camera above the Sun.
- **`E`**: Lock/Unlock the camera to the target planet.
- **`1-9`**: Switch to a specific planet (e.g., `1` for Mercury, `2` for Venus, and so on).
- **`Alt + 1-9`**: Switch to a bird's-eye view of the selected planet.
- **`X`**: Switch to a top-down view of the entire solar system.
- **Orbit Controls**: Use the mouse to pan, zoom, and rotate the camera when not locked.

---

## ⏳ **Simulation Controls**
- **`Space`**: Pause/Unpause the simulation.
- **`D`**: Cycle through distance units for planetary measurements:
  - Kilometers (`km`)
  - Astronomical Units (`AU`)
  - Light Minutes (`lm`)

---

## 🌍 **Target Planet Modifications**
- **`S`**: Slow down the target planet's speed (reduce velocity to 80% of the current value).
- **`F`**: Speed up the target planet's speed (increase velocity to 120% of the current value).
- **`M`**: Double the target planet's mass.
- **`N`**: Halve the target planet's mass.

---

## 🔍 **Display Options**
- **`O`**: Toggle visibility of planetary orbits.
- **`V`**: Show/Hide velocity and gravitational vectors.
- **`T`**: Toggle visibility of triangular formations showing:
  - The closest three-body system.
  - The farthest three-body system.
- **`I`**: Show/Hide planet information labels.

---

## 🔧 **Simulation Features**
- **`R`**: Reset all planetary orbits to their original positions.
- **`Q`**: Toggle between low-quality (`2k`) and high-quality (`8k`) planet textures.
- **`L`**: Enable/Disable realistic lighting (e.g., shadows and ambient light).
- **`K`**: Cycle through background star maps or disable the grid.

---

## 🌟 **Advanced Features**
- **`.`**: Transform the target planet into a star.
- **`P`**: Reset all planet orbits to their default paths.

---

## 📝 **Notes**
- **PAUSED mode** is indicated when the simulation is halted. Press `Space` to resume.
- For detailed planet info, lock the camera to a target planet and enable labels with `I`.
