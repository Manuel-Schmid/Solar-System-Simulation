# Infos
- Solar System simulation with accurate data (distances, radii, masses) using three.js
- Start command: npx vite
- The public/ folder is sometimes also called a "static" folder, because the files it contains are pushed to the website unchanged. Usually textures, audio, and 3D models will go here.

# Controls
- C: Center camera above the Sun
- Space: Pause/unpause simulation
- D: Cycle through distance units (km, AU, lm)
- E: Lock/unlock camera to the target planet
- S: Slow down the target planet's speed (80% of current velocity)
- F: Speed up the target planet's speed (120% of current velocity)
- M: Double the target planet's mass
- O: Toggle visibility of planetary orbits
- R: Reset orbits for all planets
- V: Toggle visibility of velocity and gravitational vectors
- T: Toggle visibility of triangular formations (planetary distances)
- 1-9: Switch to a specific planet (hold Alt for bird's-eye view)

# Todo
- time passed in simulation (consider pause)
- Saturn ring upscaling
